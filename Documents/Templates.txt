An alternative to the WPF's ControlTemplates will be mandatory.
Animations done in a VisualStateManager or similar automat will be required.
However the existing solutions force huge overhead in terms of codebase and declaration.

Following are drafts of declarations... We will need a button, splitbutton, scrollviewer, combobox etc.
The format will be either in C++ or C# code or XML, custom text probably will not be used

// we may use a CSS3 like selectors... but defined in XML...
Button
{
height:20px;
background:red;
}

Button
{
width:60px;
transition:width 1s;
transition-timing-function: ease in;
}

Button:hover
{
width:200px;
transition:width 1s;
transition-timing-function: ease in;
}

// These work fine for the properties. However we need to be able to set properties on template parts too.
// Generally there are two things to address - transitions and animations. Transitions simply transfer from one state to another, they
are frequently interrupted and reversed. Animations on the otherside are composed by frames and are prolongued.

// we need to be able to define templates such as:
ScrollBar
{
	ScrollBarPanel
	{
		Button(LineUp)
		Button(PageUp)
		Button(Slider)
		Button(PageDown)
		Button(LineDown)
	}
}

// and buttons for it
Button <template>
{
	Grid
	{
		Border { #BorderThickness, #BorderBrush, #Background }
		// template bound properties..
		// this should define BorderThickness as shorthand for Border.BorderThickness...
		// and expose it outside the control for setters...
		// Probably templatebound proeprties should not be animated?!

		Path { Geometry = <triangle shape>, #Foreground, Stroke = 1 }
	}
}
Button:hover
{
	Background: Red;
}
Button:pressed
{
	Background: Orange 2s ease in;

	// and aside from animating template properties we should be able to animate properties on the template controls
	Grid.Path.Stroke: 1 2s ease out;
}

We do not want to overlycomplicate the properties so we do not want a complex dependency-property-like system...
